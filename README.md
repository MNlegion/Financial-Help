## Description
Financial Help was designed as a Progressive Web Application (PWA) deployed via `Heroku`. This application utilizes `MongoDB` and `Express.js` for the databases and routing. This app was created as a PWA to provide users offline functionality and uninterrupted service no matter where they might be.
